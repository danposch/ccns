To ensure the quality and readability of the code we require all
contributers to follow a specific coding style. We have chosen to use the 
Google's C++ Style Guide as starting point, which is available here:

http://google-styleguide.googlecode.com/svn/trunk/cppguide.xml

Note that our coding style differs in the following points from Google's style:

* The number of whitespaces for the Tab- and Indent size is 4.
* The length of a line is not limited to 80 characters.
* The define guard is not required to base on the full path in a project's.
  source tree.
* Doxygen comments are structured as follows:
    - A brief general description is placed in the .h file.
    - Detail documentation is placed in the corresponding .cc file.
    - check src/util/BinaryBuffer to find an example.
