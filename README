Content-Centric Networking Skeleton - Implementation
=======================================================

PARC's idea of Content-Centric Netwokring(CCN) is a promising idea. Still there 
are many challanges to face in this research area and PARC has done a great job
in this field with providing CCNx. However, we think that the research community
needs a more flexible and easily exentsible implementation of the CCN protocol.
Therefore we provide the Content-Centric Networking Sekleton(CCNs), which is an 
object oriented implementation of CCN. This implementation allows the research
community to easily integrate new ideas into the current CCN framework and
evaluate them.
